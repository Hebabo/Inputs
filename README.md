# 🧪 Inputs Playground

A Flutter project for experimenting with different **input-related widgets**, demonstrating how to capture, process, and respond to user interactions.

This project includes hands-on examples of:

### 🔍 Widget Overview

- **`Autocomplete`**  
  Offers real-time suggestions to users as they type. Flutter supports:
  - **Basic Autocomplete**: Simple dropdown of suggestions based on user input.
  - **Raw Autocomplete**: Gives more control over how suggestions and fields are built.
  - **Async Autocomplete**: Loads suggestions from an asynchronous data source (e.g. network or database).

- **`Form`**  
  A container for grouping and validating multiple input fields. It manages the state and validation of its child form fields.

- **`FormField`**  
  The building block for form inputs (like `TextFormField`). It provides validation, saving, and state handling for individual fields.

- **`KeyboardListener`**  
  Detects and responds to raw keyboard events (e.g. arrow keys, shortcuts), especially useful for desktop/web apps.
